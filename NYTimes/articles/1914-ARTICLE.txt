President Bush has ordered the Treasury Department to seize about $1.7 billion in Iraqi government money that has been frozen in American bank accounts since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

The administration also began asking eight other countries to seize an additional $600 million in frozen Iraqi assets and turn it over to a new American-controlled fund intended for ''the benefit and welfare of the Iraqi people.''

Administration officials said Britain controlled about $300 million in frozen Iraqi assets, while the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands also held sizable deposits.

Administration officials threatened to cut off foreign banks from doing business in the United States if they refused to turn over either Iraqi government money or what they called ''blood money'' belonging to President Saddam Hussein or his associates.


The officials, citing a study last year by the General Accounting Office, said Mr. Hussein and his relatives and associates may have put $6 billion into foreign accounts.

''The world must find, freeze and return Iraqi money for the Iraqi people and their future,'' said John W. Snow, the secretary of the Treasury.

Treasury officials said $1.7 billion in frozen Iraqi government money was sitting in 17 banks in the United States. They range from American banks like Citigroup and Bank of America to American subsidiaries of foreign banks like Deutsche Bank, Arab Banking Corporation and Commercial Bank of Kuwait. Of that $1.7 billion, the government is reserving as much as $300 million to cover court claims in the United States awarded to victims of the Iraqi government.

All of the money is to be transferred to a new account set up by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where it will stay until it is disbursed to people or organizations in Iraq.
