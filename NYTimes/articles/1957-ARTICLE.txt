World Briefing | United Nations: No Breakthrough In Iraq Talks

The United Nations and Iraq ended three days of talks on disarmament with an agreement to meet again, but no breakthrough on the return of weapons inspectors to Baghdad. Iraq's foreign minister, Naji Sabri, called the discussions ''useful, frank and focused'' but said no dates had been set for the next round. Mr. Sabri last met with Secretary General Kofi Annan on March 7, the first high-level talks in a year. United Nations weapons inspectors began searching Iraq for weapons of mass destruction after the 1991 Persian Gulf war but left as the United States and Britain prepared to bomb the country in 1998, and they have not been allowed to return.
