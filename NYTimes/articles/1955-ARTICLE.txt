World Business Briefing | Middle East: Iraq: European Companies Buy Oil
By Bloomberg News
Sept. 28, 2002

TotalFinaElf, Eni and Repsol YPF, three of Europe's five biggest oil companies, agreed to buy oil directly from Iraq after it dropped a surcharge on sales. For Total of France, this week's purchase was the first in two years, a spokeswoman said, declining to specify the size of the cargo. Eni of Italy bought a million barrels of Iraqi oil, said Luciana Santaroni, a spokeswoman. Repsol YPF of Spain has agreed to oil exports and is awaiting United Nations clearance. The return of European companies to Iraqi ports may mean the end of a decline in sales from the nation, the Middle East's fifth-largest oil producer. Sales slid this year because of the surcharge and growing wariness about trading with the country.
