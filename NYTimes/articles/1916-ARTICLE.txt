THREATS AND RESPONSES; Havel Denies Telephoning U.S. On Iraq Meeting

In the long-running controversy over accusations that Mohamed Atta, one of the Sept. 11 hijackers, met in Prague with an Iraqi spy, a spokesman for President Vaclav Havel today denied a report on Monday in The New York Times that Mr. Havel had telephoned senior administration officials to explain that the Czechs had no proof such a meeting had taken place.

The spokesman, Ladislav Spacek, said Mr. Havel was still certain there was no factual basis behind the report that Mr. Atta met an Iraqi diplomat, Ahmad Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani, here in April 2001.

In an interview last month, Mr. Havel told The Times that he knew of no proof that the two men had met. ''I definitely wasn't at this meeting,'' Mr. Havel said with a laugh.

Today, Mr. Havel's spokesman said: ''The president did not call the White House about this. The president never spoke with any American government official about Atta, not with Bush, not with anyone else.''

Mr. Spacek said that last fall, Mr. Havel asked the Czech secret services for a report on their assertions that the two men met in Prague, and that Mr. Havel had since taken no interest in the subject. The reports gained currency after the Czech prime minister, Milos Zeman, told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that Czech secret services had confirmed reports of such a meeting. Later, Mr. Zeman's interior minister, Stanislav Gross, said repeatedly that Mr. Atta had met Mr. Ani in Prague.

But extensive interviews with Czech and other Western intelligence officials, politicians and people close to the Czech intelligence community revealed that Mr. Zeman had prematurely disclosed an unverified report.
