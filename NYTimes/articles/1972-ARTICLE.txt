A German court convicted two men of violating arms export laws by shipping drills to Iraq for the purpose of producing long-range artillery. The main defendant, Bernd Schompeter, 59, was sentenced to five years, three months in prison. His accomplice, Willi Heinz Ribbeck, 53, received two years' probation. Prosecutors said the drills, made by a German company, could be used to make artillery capable of launching chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. Mark Landler (NYT)
