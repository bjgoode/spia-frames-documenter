Turkey Warns U.S. of Difficulties in an Assault on Baghdad

Reiterating Turkey's concerns about military action against Iraq, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned the United States today that it faced a long war if it decided to topple President Saddam Hussein of Iraq by force.

Turkey, a NATO ally whose support would be vital for any operation in neighboring Iraq, has made it clear in recent weeks that it publicly opposes American military intervention. But diplomats say Turkey has been pressing the United States in private for economic support in the event of a strike that is increasingly viewed as inevitable here.

Mr. Ecevit said in a television interview that he did not know when an attack on Iraq might come, but he warned that Mr. Hussein retained the technological and economic ability to put up a long fight, despite sanctions imposed after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.

''It will not be possible to get out of there that easily,'' Mr. Ecevit said. ''President Bush is a friend of Turkey. We do not want to hurt his feelings, but it is our duty to make our concerns known.''

Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country from which American warplanes continue to enforce a no-flight zone over northern Iraq, feels aggrieved about the consequences of the gulf war, which it believes cost it billions of dollars in lost trade. In addition to asking the United States to write off more than $4 billion of debt, Turkish officials want to secure postwar development contracts in Iraq if Mr. Hussein is ousted, Western diplomats say.

Turkey also fears that a prolonged conflict could encourage Kurds in northern Iraq to demand an independent state, possibly inducing Turkish Kurds to renew a separatist guerrilla struggle that claimed 30,000 lives before a cease-fire in 1999.
