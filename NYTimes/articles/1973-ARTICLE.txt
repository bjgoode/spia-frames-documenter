Oct. 6, 2002

The chief United Nations weapons inspector, Hans Blix, endorsed the key American demand that Iraq make a full declaration of its weapons programs before any inspections resume. Dr. Blix also said there was ''very broad support'' in the Security Council for a new resolution setting tough terms for inspections. In addition, he endorsed the threat of consequences if Iraq fails to disarm. Iraq had hoped for inspections under less stringent conditions.
