SITUATION IN BAGHDAD

Bombings Continue

Buildings associated with Saddam Husseins power continued to be bombed on Friday, including his official residence and the Presidential Compund a district that includes the Presidential Palace and barracks for the Republican Guard. Under the wings of the palace are bunkers used by high-ranking Iraqi officials.

Palaces Hit

Prior targets are struck again on Saturday along with strikes on the Republican Palace, which serves as the Iraqi equivalent of the White House. The Sajida Palace, named for Mr. Hussein's wife, is also severely damaged.

More Strikes

The soldiers fire shots into the high grass along the river's shores. Allied bombing targets include the General Security Directorate and an area near the Iraqi air defense headquarters.
