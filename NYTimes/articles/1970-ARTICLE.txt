American and British warplanes bombed an air-defense system in northern Iraq yesterday, officials said. An Iraqi antiaircraft battery east of Mosul fired on the warplanes, a European Command statement said, and the British and American jets then dropped their bombs and completed their patrol in the no-flight zone of northern Iraq without being struck. The official Iraqi News Agency, however, described the bombing as an attack on civilian targets, and made no mention of injuries. Thom Shanker(NYT)
