The Pentagon has ordered 20,000 additional Army troops to the Persian Gulf, including an armored unit from Colorado, as part of the steady buildup for a potential war with Iraq, military officials said today.

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld signed a deployment order to dispatch the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment, based at Fort Carson, Colo., to Kuwait, Pentagon officials said.

The regiment, which has more than 320 M1 tanks and Bradley armored vehicles, as well as Apache helicopter gunships, is a mobile force that can conduct reconnaissance, security and attack operations.

In addition to the regiment's 4,700 troops, the deployment order also dispatched about 15,000 other Army forces to the region, a Pentagon official said. The official said he did not have details about the other units involved.

The United States now has about 150,000 air, land and naval forces in the gulf region or nearby, a total that will approach 200,000 by the end of the month, Pentagon officials said.

As the buildup continued, American and British warplanes attacked Iraqi missile systems today, the fifth strike on Iraqi assets in a week, the Pentagon said. Allied jets struck two Iraqi mobile surface-to-air missile systems located near Basra.
