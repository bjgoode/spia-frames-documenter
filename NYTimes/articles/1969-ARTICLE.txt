Sept. 1-7: NATIONAL; IRAQ HEARINGS IN CONGRESS
By David Firestone
Sept. 8, 2002

Hours after President Bush agreed to make Congress a partner in deciding whether to invade Iraq, members from both parties began gearing up the cumbersome legislative process to reach a decision. At least six committees plan several weeks of hearings to determine whether an invasion is justified and would work, and the airwaves will most likely be full of supporters and opponents through October. Legislative leaders said they might delay a vote until after the Nov. 7 midterm elections. David Firestone
