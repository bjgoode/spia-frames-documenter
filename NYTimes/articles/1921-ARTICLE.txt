THREATS AND RESPONSES; Iraq Hopes Oil Sways Russians On Vote in U.N.
Oct. 2, 2002

A deputy oil minister from Iraq will come to Moscow on Wednesday for a two-day lobbying effort with Russia, as it decides how to respond to the Bush administration's proposed resolution on Iraqi weapons.

The deputy minister, Husein al-Hasidi, will ''meet with his colleagues in Russia and with representatives of Russian oil companies to increase cooperation over oil in the framework of the U.N. program,'' said Abbas Khalaf Kunfuth, the Iraqi ambassador to Russia. The visit comes as Russian and American oil executives met in Houston.

Iraq's oil is one of the stakes for Russia in making a decision. Russia wants assurances from the United States that it would not repudiate existing contracts if there is a change of leadership in Iraq, but no promise has been made publicly.

A panel of political analysts generally agreed today that Russia will try to put off a decision on the resolution until the very last minute. Russia, which has a veto in the Security Council that could block the American proposal, is trying to make the most of it. Now everyone needs Russia's support, said Sergei Markov, director of the Moscow-based Institute of Political Studies.

Other commentators conceded that President Vladimir V. Putin is facing a difficult choice. Supporting the United States would tarnish Russia's image among Arab countries, but spoiling relations with the United States would be worse, said Aleksei Malashenko, scholar-in-residence at the Carnegie Moscow Center.

''Russia wants one thing -- for this resolution never to have come into existence,'' he said. ''It will lose either way.''
