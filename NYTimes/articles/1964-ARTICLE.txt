DECEMBER 15-21: INTERNATIONAL; HARSH WORDS FOR IRAQ
By David E. Sanger
Dec. 22, 2002

The Bush administration declared that Iraq was in ''material breach'' of its commitment to reveal all of its weapons of mass destruction, saying Baghdad's 12,000-page report was empty of answers about what happened to its chemical, biological and nuclear programs.

The news was delivered by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who sounded uncharacteristically hawkish as he explained that if Iraq failed to come up with answers, war would be almost unavoidable. Iraq called the whole exercise a charade run by a White House that is planning on war anyway. David E. Sanger
