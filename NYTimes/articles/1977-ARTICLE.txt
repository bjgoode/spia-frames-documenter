For the second time this week American warplanes attacked Iraqi air defense sites south of Baghdad after British or American jets came under fire, military officials said. The United States Central Command said two targets, a combat control center and an antiaircraft missile system, had been destroyed by precision-guided munitions. Iraq said the raids had killed two.
