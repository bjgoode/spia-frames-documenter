THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; Shares Mixed on Varied Economic News and Iraq Talk

Stocks were mixed yesterday as news on the economy and continued talk about action against Iraq kept the outlook cloudy. Although stocks managed to climb on Monday and Tuesday before the Sept. 11 commemoration, they fell Wednesday and Thursday and are down for the third consecutive week.

But as stocks fell, bond prices rose and yields declined, keeping interest rates at or near their lowest levels in decades. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 3.91 percent, the lowest yield on a government security with a 10-year maturity since 1963.

At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 66.72 points, or 0.8 percent, at 8,312.69. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.90 points, or 0.3 percent, to 889.81. The Nasdaq composite index gained 11.72 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,291.40. For the week, the Dow was down 1.4 percent, the S.& P. index was off 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.3 percent.

In addition to the economic news, the Dow was dragged lower by Honeywell International, the aerospace company, which cut its profit forecast late Thursday. Shares of Honeywell plunged $4.78, or 16.9 percent, to $23.56, accounting for half of the Dow's decline.

United Technologies also helped pull the Dow lower after an analyst at J. P. Morgan reduced his profit forecast for the company. The stock fell $3.10, or 5.1 percent, to $58.

The Nasdaq was helped higher by Microsoft, up 76 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.91, and Intel, up 33 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.03.

Tyco International fell yesterday after its shares held steady on Thursday when three former executives, including the former chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, were indicted. Shares of Tyco, which makes products ranging from surgical instruments to security systems, dropped 92 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $16.88.

The preliminary report on September consumer confidence showed a decline to 86.2 from a final reading of 87.6 in August, according to the University of Michigan. That was the lowest reading since November, when the confidence index was at 83.9.

On the positive side, retail sales rose 0.8 percent in August, after a revised 1.1 percent (down from 1.2 percent) increase in July. The August increase was above Wall Street forecasts of 0.5 percent and showed stronger-than-expected growth in nonauto sales, another plus.

Many economists had been awaiting the retail numbers to give support to their forecasts that growth in the third quarter, which ends this month, would be 3.5 percent at an annual rate or slightly higher. Yesterday's numbers did that, meaning this quarter's pace will be three times that of the second quarter.

But, at the same time, the weakness in consumer confidence worries analysts. If confidence continues to decline, consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, will slow. That would mean the economy could weaken in the last three months of the year.

Some economists have said they expect confidence to fall further and consumer spending to slow if the economy continues to create jobs at the slow pace it has over the last four months.

Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & Company, took a more positive position. ''Given the 9/11 anniversary, threat of war with Iraq, lower stock prices, and higher jobless claims, consumers are rationally expressing their anxieties,'' he said of the drop in consumer confidence. ''But today's retail sales data and the retail sales trend shows that it is better to watch what consumers do and not what they say.''

In other economic news, the Producer Price Index was unchanged in August while the so-called core index, which excludes food and energy, declined 0.1 percent. Both numbers were better than Wall Street forecasts.

In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 16/32, to 103 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.91 percent, from 3.97 percent on Thursday and 4.02 percent a week ago.

The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is often sensitive to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, fell to 2.04 percent, from 2.09 percent on Thursday and 2.05 percent a week ago. The recent low for the two-year note was 1.89 percent on Aug. 5.
