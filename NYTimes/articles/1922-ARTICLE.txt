A NATION AT WAR; Iraqis Pull Back

Iraqi soldiers have pulled back from two front-line positions around the strategic city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq, Kurdish officials said today.

Both withdrawals, made early Friday, appeared to be organized efforts to minimize the risk of bombardment, rather than panicked retreats.

The Iraqis who withdrew faced no ground attack from American or Kurdish forces, but had endured days of bombardment from American planes. Kurdish officials said six Iraqi soldiers defected just before the withdrawal here, but they declined to provide access to them. Iraqi forces withdrew from a third front-line position east of Kirkuk earlier in the week.

The pullback exposed a network of crude but extensive bunkers and a mass of land mines. Kurdish soldiers here showed off at least 50 antitank and another 50 antipersonnel mines that they said Iraqis had planted on and beside the two-lane asphalt road.

Elsewhere in Kurdish Iraq, the United States continued to fly troops and mat√©riel into two airstrips. American forces are massing in the pocket of territory where Kurds who broke with Mr. Hussein in 1991 have maintained years of self-rule under American protection. American planes have been heavily bombing targets in and around Kirkuk and Mosul, a second government-held city, for the last several days.

Maj. Rob Gowan, a spokesman for the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which flew into an airstrip in Harir on Wednesday night, said the entire brigade was now on the ground. He declined to give exact troop numbers but said the force included ''a few thousand'' paratroopers.
