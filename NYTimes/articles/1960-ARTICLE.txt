Iran and Iraq will exchange about 1,600 of war on March 17, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. ''Iran will release 1,241 Iraqi prisoners, who will be the last remaining group of Iraqi prisoners of war left in Iran,'' the agency quoted Hamidreza Assefi, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, as saying. Iraq will release 349 Iranians, he said. Since the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq, the countries have exchanged thousands of prisoners and remains of dead soldiers. They have not yet signed a formal peace treaty, and the exchange of prisoners of war has been a major obstacle to normalization of ties. Nazila Fathi (NYT)
