Shipments of Iraqi fuel oil into Turkey resumed through the border gate at Habur in southeastern Turkey. The shipments, which are outside the United Nations oil-for-food program, are tolerated by the United States and its allies because of the damaging effect on the Turkish economy of sanctions against Iraq. About 100 Turkish trucks a day will be permitted to return from northern Iraq carrying diesel oil and other fuel, border officials said. The flow was shut off four months ago when the Iraqi government stopped shipments to the Kurds in northern Iraq and is resuming now that the oil has begun to flow again. Before the shutoff, as many as 1,000 trucks a day made the trip. Douglas Frantz (NYT)
