Yuli M. Vorontsov, the United Nations official responsible for tracking Kuwaitis who disappeared in the months after Iraq's 1990 invasion, said Iraq would sooner or later have to reveal the fate of more than 600 missing Kuwaitis and others who disappeared. Mr. Voronstsov, who spoke in Cairo, is touring the region for talks on how to increase Iraqi cooperation on the issue. Iraq says that it lost all track of any prisoners during the uprising by Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq immediately after its withdrawal from Kuwait. Neil MacFarquhar (NYT)
