November 3-9: INTERNATIONAL; IRAQ ON NOTICE
By Daniel B. Schneider
Nov. 10, 2002

Culminating weeks of negotiations, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a tough resolution, drafted by the United States and Britain, requiring that Iraq show it has abandoned its weapons of mass destruction or face ''serious consequences.'' The carefully worded resolution -- France pressed for specific language -- preserves Washington's right to mount an attack if Iraq fails to comply with a strict new inspections regime, but also calls for a second round of Security Council deliberations should those inspections bog down. Iraq has seven days to announce whether it intends to comply. Daniel B. Schneider
