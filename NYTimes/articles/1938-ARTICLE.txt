THREATS AND RESPONSES; German Minister Softens Stance Against Iraq War
Dec. 29, 2002

In an apparent softening of the German government's position, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer declined to rule out the possibility of Germany voting for military action against Iraq in the United Nations Security Council.

Though Mr. Fischer, a member of the Green Party, reiterated the government's position that it will under no circumstances contribute troops to a war in Iraq, his comments reflected a degree of flexibility absent in Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der's earlier insistence that Germany would not support a war even in the event of an affirmative vote in the Security Council.

When asked in an interview in the German weekly Der Spiegel, whether Germany would consider voting in favor of military action, Mr. Fischer responded, ''No one can say in advance what will happen, as no one knows how and under what terms the Security Council will deal with this.''

Mr. Fischer's comments drew support from the Social Democrats, his senior partners in the government coalition.

But Mr. Fischer's comments were immediately criticized by other members of his own party, who decried his comments as a betrayal of the government's critical stance against the war and a ''complete transformation'' of his earlier position.
