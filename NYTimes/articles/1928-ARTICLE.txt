THREATS AND RESPONSES: INTELLIGENCE; Iraq Plotting To Use Garb Of the Allies, U.S. Says

President Saddam Hussein is seeking uniforms that are ''identical down to the last detail'' to those worn by American and British troops, so that atrocities carried out by Iraqi forces could be blamed on the allies, a senior Defense Department official said today.

James R. Wilkinson, chief spokesman for the United States Central Command, said Mr. Hussein had ordered the uniforms for use by members of his paramilitary force, Fedayeen Saddam.

These forces, Mr. Wilkinson said, ''would wear them when conducting reprisals against the Iraqi people so that they could pass the atrocities off as the work of the United States and the United Kingdom.''

Mr. Wilkinson did not divulge how the American military had learned of the uniforms or of Mr. Hussein's intentions.


Senior Pentagon and military officials have warned that Mr. Hussein might harm his own people -- especially those who rise up to oust him -- and attempt to blame the United States, even using chemical or biological weapons on rebellious members of the Iraqi population.

The 15,000-member force was founded by Uday Hussein, one of the president's sons, in 1994, with many members recruited from areas noted for loyalty to the leadership.

''The force carries out patrols and antismuggling duties, and is separate from the Army command, reporting directly to the presidential palace,'' a military statement said. ''Though not an elite force, the group does deal with unrest during an emergency.''
