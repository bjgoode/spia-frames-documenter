American warplanes bombed an aircraft tracking site south of Baghdad after Iraqi air defenses fired at British or American jets patrolling the no-flight zone for the second time in 12 days, the Pentagon said. The military's Central Command said that Iraq had fired at coalition aircraft nearly 1,100 times since December 1998 and that Iraqi aircraft had violated the southern zone more than 160 times in that period. The latest in the decade-long exchanges between Iraqi air defenses and allied aircraft came as the United Nations discusses the return of weapons inspectors to Iraq and as speculation swirls over possible American plans to topple President Saddam Hussein.
