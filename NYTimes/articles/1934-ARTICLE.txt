THREATS AND RESPONSES; New Allies Back U.S. Iraq Policy
Feb. 6, 2003

Ten Eastern European countries all aspirants to NATO membership -- have united behind a strongly worded statement of support for the United States in a further sign of the increasingly polarized positions in Europe toward a possible war in Iraq.

The gesture highlighted the division between newer allies of the former Soviet bloc who are staunchly pro-American and the more traditional allies of the United States, notably Germany and France, who are skeptical of the American position on Iraq.

''Our countries understand the dangers posed by tyranny and the special responsibility of democracies to defend our shared values,'' the statement said. ''The trans-Atlantic community, of which we are a part, must stand together to face the threat posed by the nexus of terrorism and dictators with weapons of mass destruction.''

The statement was much firmer toward Iraq than a letter last week from nine European countries -- including Britain, Spain and Italy, but not France or Germany -- urging support for the United States.


The signers of today's statement included five countries set to join the European Union next year -- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and two countries scheduled to join in 2007 -- Bulgaria and Romania. The other signers were Albania, Croatia and Macedonia.
