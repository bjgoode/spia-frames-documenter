THREATS AND RESPONSES; 2 at Iraq's Mission To the U.N. Ordered To Leave the U.S.
March 6, 2003

Two attach√©s at Iraq's mission to the United Nations have been expelled by the State Department because ''they were involved in activities deemed harmful to the United States and they abused their privilege of residence,'' Richard A. Grenell, a spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations, said today.

The two, Nazih Rahman and Yehia Suaoud, were informed Tuesday that they must leave the country by midnight Friday, Mr. Grenell said.

Law enforcement officials said the two men worked as security guards and were living in the Iraqi Mission. But they said the pair actually were intelligence officers, though officials declined to detail the nature of their reported spying.

Last month, an Iraqi journalist, Muhammad Hassan Allawai, who was the Iraqi News Agency's correspondent at the United Nations, was told to leave the country after American counterintelligence officials said he had been spying.


The expulsions, which resulted from an investigation by the national security division of the New York F.B.I. office, appear to be part of a stepped-up effort by the Bush administration to disrupt Iraqi intelligence operations.

Confirming a report by ABC News, State Department officials said that the United States had asked other countries around the world to expel Iraqi intelligence agents posing as diplomats working out of Iraqi embassies. Administration officials said these Iraqi intelligence agents might pose a threat to American facilities and interests.
