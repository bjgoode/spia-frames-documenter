THREATS AND RESPONSES; Iraq to Be the Leader Of Disarmament Body
Feb. 1, 2003

In an embarrassing coincidence for the United Nations, Iraq is to take over as chairman of the disarmament conference in Geneva for four workweeks, officials here announced today.

Just as the United States is preparing to go to war to disarm Iraq by force, it was announced that the country would step into the chairman's position from March 17 to May 25 after Iran abruptly stood aside, giving no explanation.

The country to lead the conference is chosen by English-language alphabetical order; each country serves for four workweeks. The conference will observe several weeks of holiday during Iraq's tenure.

The conference is nominally the United Nations' main forum for discussion of disarmament issues, but in more than two decades it has never been able to agree on a program of work.
