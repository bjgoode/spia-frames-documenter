Western dictums about absolute power don't have much currency in Iraq, but they came readily to a visitor's mind after Saddam Hussein's hierarchy claimed that he had won 100 percent of the 11.4 million votes cast in a single-candidate presidential referendum. The Baghdad leadership, under threat of war from the U.S., did not have much leeway in its quest for a result that would signify Iraq's resolve, since Mr. Hussein drew 99.96 percent in the last referendum in 1995.
