Malnutrition and death rates are declining and education is improving in Iraq as a result of a United Nations program that supplies food, medicines and equipment, an official of the world organization reported today.

The official, Benon V. Savan, directs the program that manages Iraq's oil exports and uses the revenues to aid the civilian population. Mr. Savan said that despite the gains, his work continued to be hampered by severe cash shortages, and that electricity and drinking water were still unavailable in many areas.

Iraq's oil sales have fallen sharply since 2000, Mr. Savan reported, from an average of more than two million barrels a day then to less than a million a day in recent months. He estimated that $3.2 billion in potential revenues for the aid program had been lost.

However Mr. Savan said today that Iraq had recently stopped charging a premium on its oil , which it had imposed to get cash that would not pass through United Nations monitoring. The premium scared away many buyers.
