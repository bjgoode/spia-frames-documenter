THREATS AND RESPONSES: NO-FLIGHT ZONES; Allied Jets Bomb Military Site; Iraq Says Air Strike Killed 3
Dec. 27, 2002

Warplanes from the American-British coalition enforcing no-flight zones over Iraq bombed a military command-and-control post about 175 miles southeast of Baghdad today, officials said.

The strike, near Tallil, was ordered after Iraqi warplanes crossed into the southern no-flight area, the United States Central Command said in a statement issued from its headquarters in Tampa, Fla.

In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said that the attack killed 3 people and wounded 16 others, and that the bombs or missiles struck civilian targets, including a mosque.

''The evil criminals in the evil American administration and its humble servant Britain added a new crime to their black record against civilization and humanity and the houses of God,'' the news agency said.

The statement by the Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Persian Gulf, said, ''Coalition aircraft never target civilian populations or infrastructure and go to painstaking lengths to avoid injury to civilians and damage to civilian facilities.''

The United States, France and Britain set up the no-flight zones to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions and cease-fire agreements from the Persian Gulf war.

France no longer sends its aircraft on the enforcement missions.
