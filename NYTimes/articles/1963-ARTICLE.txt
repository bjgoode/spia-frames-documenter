The Glen Canyon chapter of the Sierra Club is facing expulsion over its opposition to military action against Iraq. After the national office expressed support of a strategy to remove any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a safeguard against the environment, the branch expressed its own position, saying the Bush administration's plans ''will produce a state of perpetual war,'' risking protections against the environment already in place. Carl Pope, the club's executive director, said dissolving the chapter was a ''last resort'' if members did not follow national club policy. Michael Janofsky (NYT)
