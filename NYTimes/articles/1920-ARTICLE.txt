THREATS AND RESPONSES; Baghdad Stirred U.N.'s Interest in Sites

The intense interest of United Nations weapons experts in President Saddam Hussein's palaces was awakened by Baghdad itself, when it abruptly declared in December 1997 that the inspectors would be barred from eight sites it called ''presidential and sovereign.''

It was not that the inspectors hoped to poke around in Mr. Hussein's closets and look under his bedroom slippers. But they, with the backing of the Security Council, were alarmed at Baghdad's attempt to create sanctuaries from United Nations scrutiny.

The concern grew when Iraq laid down the boundaries of the off-limits areas. The one surrounding Mr. Hussein's main palace in Baghdad included many city blocks and dozens of buildings and warehouses.

In all, the sites covered about 12 square miles; the largest one, at Radwaniyah, was about 7 square miles. A United Nations survey showed that about a third of the total was covered with artificial lakes that Mr. Hussein built in the desert to adorn his palaces.

In February 1998, Secretary General Kofi Annan went to Baghdad to work out procedures for the inspectors to enter the sites. The procedures required inspectors to have senior diplomats with them and notify Iraq in advance of their arrival.

When the first inspections of the sites were carried out in April 1998, Iraqi officials argued and delayed over numerous details.

Resolution 1441, which the Security Council adopted unanimously on Nov. 8, eliminated all restrictions on the inspectors' access to the presidential sites. The inspection on Tuesday at Al Sajoud Palace in Baghdad, one of the smaller sites, was the first to test the inspectors' new powers.
