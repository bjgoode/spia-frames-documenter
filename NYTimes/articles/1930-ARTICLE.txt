The Nation; Iraqs Long March of Defiance

IRAQS acquiescence last week to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which promised severe consequences for ''continued violations of its obligations,'' resembled just one more turn in a dysfunctional relationship. But it was more complicated than that.

The Security Councils language of severe consequences and the bipolar Iraqi response (Iraqs parliament rejected the resolution before Saddam Hussein made a show of grudging acceptance) appeared to follow an unhealthy pattern. In 1991, Resolution 687 brokered an end to the gulf war and earned a commitment from Mr. Hussein to disarm and allow U.N. inspectors to come in and oversee things. But the relationship quickly soured.

Each new period of cooperation by Iraq was quickly followed by stalling and sidestepping, and then by limited cooperation again. In a cycle of geopolitical codependency, the U.N. passed new resolutions that reconfirmed old ones and that the Iraqis quickly ignored. Inspectors eventually walked away in 1998, frustrated, stonewalled and in some cases manhandled by Iraqi officials who, by most accounts, were playing a shell game with weapons of mass destruction.

Still, almost no one believes the current go-round will follow the standard script, with the United States mobilizing for war even as it abides by the Security Councils latest 12-step program. Below is a look back at the past year and inside, the past decade of a long-running routine that may well be nearing an end. TOM ZELLER
