THREATS AND RESPONSES; Germany to Lead Iraq Sanctions Panel
Jan. 8, 2003

Despite initial opposition from the United States, the Security Council appointed Germany today to the chairmanship of the committee monitoring economic sanctions against Iraq.

The Bush administration had tried to block the appointment after Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der said he would not send German troops in case of a war with Iraq. Washington dropped its objections after France and Russia supported Germany's bid.

Germany, one of five countries to join the Council last week for a two-year term, held the committee chairmanship in 1995-96 and is taking over from Norway. The committee decides the price of oil exported from Iraq and the kinds of goods sent to Iraq.

Chile and Spain, Washington's candidates for the position, will take over committees monitoring Al Qaeda and counterterrorism, respectively.
