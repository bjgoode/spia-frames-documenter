THREATS AND RESPONSES; Senior Bush Defends '91 Decision on Iraq

Former President George H. W. Bush has defended his decision not to remove Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, from power in 1991, saying that allowing American troops to march on Baghdad would have ''instantly shattered'' the coalition that had supported Operation Desert Storm in Kuwait.

In a speech at Tufts University on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said that keeping the ''unprecedented international coalition'' together helped build momentum for a Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991 that included Arab states like Egypt and Jordan.

''The Madrid conference would never have happened,'' Mr. Bush said, ''if the United States had gone on its own, had gone into Baghdad after Saddam and his forces had surrendered and agreed to disarm.''

In describing the importance of coalition-building and the perils of unilateralism, Mr. Bush presented an internationalist world view that many Democrats contend clashes with the policies of his son, President George W. Bush.

The younger Mr. Bush has steadfastly said he is willing to use military force to oust Mr. Hussein with or without United Nations backing.

The elder Mr. Bush said it was ''totally false'' to accuse his son of wanting to ''go it alone, rush into war.'' But when asked if he was troubled by his son's apparent willingness to invade Iraq without broad-based international support, Mr. Bush offered a more nuanced answer, saying that it was easier to build a coalition in 1991 because ''the objective was clearer.''

''You could see the occupying forces,'' he said, referring to Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
