THREATS AND RESPONSES; Outsiders Will Be Given Time to Leave Iraq
March 7, 2003

President Bush said tonight that, in the event of war in Iraq, he would give United Nations weapons inspectors, relief workers and foreign journalists sufficient time to leave.

''Of course,'' he said. ''We will give people a chance to leave.''

He said that the United States did not want to put noncombatants in harm's way. ''The journalists who are there should leave,'' he said. ''If you're going and we start action, leave.''

Mr. Bush added: ''We have no quarrel with anybody other than Saddam and his group of killers, who have destroyed a society. We will do everything we can, as I mentioned -- and I mean this -- to protect innocent life.''

Russian and Bulgarian diplomats began leaving Baghdad today, fearing for their safety in case of war.
