The Russian commodities trading firm Alfa-Eco concluded its largest oil contract with Iraq ''over the past several days,'' under a United Nations program that allows the regime of Saddam Hussein to sell oil and use the proceeds to buy food. A spokesman said Alfa-Eco would buy 20 million barrels of oil from Iraq. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)
