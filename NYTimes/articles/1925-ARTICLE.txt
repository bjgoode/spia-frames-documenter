THREATS AND RESPONSES: VIEW FROM BEIJING; In Shift, China Seems to Back a Resolution on Iraq

The government has provided hints over the past two days that it may not stand in the way of a strong new United Nations resolution to demand that Iraq admit arms inspectors.

A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, with veto power, China has often stated its opposition to unilateral American military action, while also urging Iraq to honor existing resolutions.

The government has not commented on the presentation supporting Washington that Prime Minister Tony Blair made Tuesday to the British Parliament. But in discussing the American proposal for a tougher Security Council resolution, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman did not oppose the idea. ''I think if there is such a resolution draft, we would be willing to study it,'' said the spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue.

Today an editorial in the main state-run English-language newspaper, The China Daily, issued an unusually blunt warning to the Iraqi government, demanding that it comply with United Nations requirements. ''This is the last chance for Saddam Hussein to deprive the Americans of a legal case against himself,'' the editorial said, though it also warned the United Nations to avoid any reckless action going beyond its proper authority.

China is pursuing closer relations with the United States and calls itself a partner in the war on terror, and American officials hope Beijing will at least abstain on any resolution in the Security Council that would authorize military action if Iraq did not comply fully with the council's earlier resolutions.
