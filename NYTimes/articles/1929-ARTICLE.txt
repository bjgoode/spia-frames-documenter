A NATION CHALLENGED; Pilot Could be Hostage in Iraq, Bush Says
March 14, 2002


President Bush said today that he ''wouldn't put it past'' President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to have secretly held an American pilot hostage for more than a decade.

Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Bush indicated that he did not know for certain the fate of Lt. Cmdr. Michael Scott Speicher, a Navy fighter pilot who was shot down over Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf war.

The Pentagon, which initially declared Commander Speicher killed in action, changed his status last year to ''missing in action'' based on new evidence that he survived the crash of his F-18 jet.

Recent intelligence reports described to members of Congress have bolstered hopes that Commander Speicher might be alive.

''Let me just say this to you: I know that the man has had an M.I.A. status, and it reminds me once again about the nature of Saddam Hussein, if in fact he's alive,'' Mr. Bush said.

Mr. Bush said Iraq's refusal to account for the pilot reinforced his view of Mr. Hussein. He professed disbelief ''that anybody would be so cold and heartless as to hold an American flier for all this period of time without notification to his family.'' But, Mr. Bush said, he ''wouldn't put it past him, given the fact that he gassed his own people.''

Victoria Clarke, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said today that the Pentagon is working hard to determine Commander Speicher's status.
