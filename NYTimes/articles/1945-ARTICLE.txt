THREATS AND RESPONSES; A Wary Patience Promised on Iraq
Nov. 15, 2002

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that the United States would exercise patience in monitoring Iraq's compliance with demands that it disarm. But he said this did not mean there would be ''a couple of free passes'' before military action was sought.

Speaking after a meeting with the Canadian foreign minister, Bill Graham, Secretary Powell responded to comments made on Wednesday by the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, that Washington must be ''a bit patient'' and avoid a rush toward military action against Iraq.

Secretary Powell said that he understood Mr. Annan's ''desire to give this process time'' but that there was also a need to send a strong message to Baghdad that any efforts to impede inspections would have serious consequences.

The secretary avoided discussing whether a violation of the no-flight zone by Iraqi armed forces would constitute a ''material breach'' of the resolution, except to say that any effort to endanger the safety of inspectors would be taken very seriously.
