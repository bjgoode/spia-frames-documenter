February 9-15: INTERNATIONAL; SETBACK ON IRAQ

The Bush administration signaled all week that it was as determined as ever to go to war in Iraq unless Saddam Hussein disarms. But by week's end, the chances of proceeding with the support of allies in the United Nations and NATO seemed to diminish. The chief U.N. weapons inspectors reported some progress, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell faced deep resistance to his call for a Security Council decision to authorize military force. France and Germany, in particular, demanded more time for the inspectors to complete their work, creating the biggest cleavage in the NATO alliance in a generation.

Washington kept the nation on a heightened terror alert, with the threat level remaining at Code Orange. Seeking to calm a jittery public, though, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said the government had no new intelligence to suggest an imminent attack. Steven R. Weisman
