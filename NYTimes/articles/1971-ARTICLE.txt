United Nations weapons inspectors returned to Iraq for the first time since 1998, beginning a process that could determine whether the United States uses force to oust Saddam Hussein. Inspectors found nothing suspicious in their first searches, which included visits at a vaccine laboratory at Al Dawrah and at a suspected uranium-enriching plant at Al Nasr. The searches were considered warm-ups to next Sunday, when Iraq must declare all its weapons programs. James Dao
