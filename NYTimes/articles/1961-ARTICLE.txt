President Leonid D. Kuchma's administration brusquely rejected American accusations that Mr. Kuchma had approved a plot to smuggle military equipment into Iraq in 2000, saying the White House was acting in concert with antigovernment protesters who want to topple him. ''The interests of certain political circles in Ukraine and abroad coincide,'' Mr. Kuchma's top aide, Viktor Medvedchuk, said. The United States said on Monday that it has suspended $55 million in aid to Ukraine after concluding that Mr. Kuchma approved a plan to sell Iraq a radar system that could detect approaching objects without their knowledge.
