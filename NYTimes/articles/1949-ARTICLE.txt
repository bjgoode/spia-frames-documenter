FEB.23-MARCH 1: INTERNATIONAL; FOR IRAQ AFTER HUSSEIN
By David E. Sanger
March 2, 2003

President Bush appeared finished with arguing over inspections, disarmament, or whether it is still possible to contain Iraq. In a speech, he described what a world free of Mr. Hussein would look like, a world of ''liberated Iraqis,'' spreading democratization in the Middle East, and ultimately peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Mr. Bush's critics called it an optimistic fantasy.

Meanwhile, in Baghdad, Mr. Hussein began talking as if he might begin destroying his Al Samoud missiles, as the United Nations had ordered, even though he had insisted during an interview with Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, that those missiles are legal. Mr. Bush dismissed the missiles as ''the tip of the iceberg.'' (In the interview, Mr. Hussein suggested a debate with Mr. Bush. The White House said the idea wasn't

serious.) David E. Sanger
