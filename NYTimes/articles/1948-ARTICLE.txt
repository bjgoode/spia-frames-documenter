A NATION AT WAR; Strikes From the Air, And a New Iraqi Tactic
March 30, 2003

Four American soldiers were killed in a suicide car bombing at a checkpoint near Najaf signaling a new tactic in the effort by Iraqi forces to slow the allied advance. In Baghdad, the Information Ministry building was damaged in a predawn missile attack. Northeast of Basra, a Baath Party assembly of an estimated 200 people was bombed. Elsewhere in the region, the Pentagon suspended some attacks from the Red Sea after cruise missiles aimed at Iraq landed in Saudi Arabia.

A legend yesterday with the main map of military developments in and around Iraq referred incorrectly in some copies to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's statement on Friday about weapons entering Iraq from Syria. He called on the Syrian government to stop the arms flow; he did not accuse the government of sending the weapons.
