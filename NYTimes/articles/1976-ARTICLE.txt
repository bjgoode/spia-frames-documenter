A trial began for six Iraqi asylum-seekers who stormed the Iraqi Embassy in Berlin last August. They are accused of holding four people hostage, including the Iraqi charg√© d'affaires, before a police raid ended the five-hour siege. Defense lawyers say the action was a peaceful protest against the government of Saddam Hussein. A verdict is expected in May. Victor Homola (NYT)
