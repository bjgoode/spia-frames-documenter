Iraq said it would allow a United Nations human rights investigator to visit for the first time in a decade, according to the United Nations. The organization's human rights commission, which said last year that Iraq repressed and terrorized its citizens, appointed a special investigator in 1991 but Iraq has allowed only one visit, in 1992.
