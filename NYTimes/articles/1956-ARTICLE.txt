A second round of talks between Iraq's foreign minister, Naji Sabri, and Secretary General Kofi Annan has been postponed at Iraq's request, the United Nations said. Iraq sought the delay because it did not want to draw attention from the crisis in the Middle East, according to Fred Eckhard, Mr. Annan's spokesman. The talks, scheduled for next Thursday and Friday, were to focus on the resumption of United Nations inspections for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in Iraq. Mr. Sabri and the secretary general met on March 7, their first high-level talks in more than a year. ''We are in the process of trying to find new suitable dates for these discussions,'' Mr. Eckhard said.
