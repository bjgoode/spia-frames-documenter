Iraq Offers Help Over Pilot
April 11, 2002

The United States has received a formal offer from Iraq to help determine the fate of a Navy fighter pilot shot down in the Persian Gulf war, and the Pentagon is weighing whether to send a team of investigators, officials said today.

Lt. Col. David Lapan, of the Marines, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Iraqi letter was sent from Baghdad via the International Committee of the Red Cross and was received Monday. No decision has been made whether to send a team to gather information on the pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Michael Scott Speicher, who was shot down over Iraq in 1991. Details of the Iraqi offer and consideration of a response were first reported in The Washington Times today.
