BUSINESS TRAVEL: MEMO PAD; U.S. Airlines Have Iraq Policy

What happens to airline schedules if there is a war in Iraq?

Donald J. Carty, the chief executive of American Airlines, provided a clue in Washington last week when he suggested that the airlines might reduce some schedules soon after a war began to respond to an expected sudden drop in demand for travel.

Mr. Carty, who testified before Congress last week along with the Northwest Airlines chief executive, Richard Anderson, also acknowledged that the terrorist attacks of 2001 were not the only cause of the major airlines' current dismal condition.

''Our industry would have been faced with fundamental change even without 9/11 or the economic slowdown,'' he told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Discount airlines, ''unconstrained by and uninterested in the old rules of the game,'' now compete on three-quarters of the majors' routes, while the Internet ''has made airline pricing completely transparent to anyone with a PC,'' Mr. Carty said, explaining that these were some of the ''forces driving our current problems.''
