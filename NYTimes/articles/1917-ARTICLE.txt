He deserted Saddam Hussein's army, was locked up in Saddam Hussein's prisons and eventually escaped from Saddam Hussein's tyranny to make his way here.

Now he is gearing up to go back to Iraq, hoping it will be the last time his path will cross Mr. Hussein's.

The man's name is Sultan, one of hundreds of Iraqi exiles who have volunteered to take part in an American military training program to help United States-led forces in Iraq should it come to war there.

''It's our duty to liberate our country and restore order there,'' said Mr. Sultan, 40, who asked that his full name not be used, fearing possible retribution against his family in Iraq.


Several dozen Iraqi volunteers from North America were the first to arrive in late January at an American military air base in Taszar, Hungary, where the training ranges from self-defense and how to don protective gear against a chemical attack to a course on human rights.

The Iraqis would not take part in combat, but would serve as a link between coalition forces and the Iraqi people, said Maj. Bob Stern, an American military spokesman in Taszar.

Hundreds of Iraqi expatriates from across Europe are expected to arrive in Taszar in the coming weeks, including some from the Netherlands, said Master Sgt. John Tomassi, a spokesman for the United States European Command in Stuttgart, Germany.

The volunteers range in age from 20 to 50 and include a couple of doctors and engineers, Mr. Sultan said. Some, like him, come from southern Iraq and are Shiite Muslims. Others are Kurds from northern Iraq.

All share a desire to see Mr. Hussein toppled. ''Saddam is a butcher,'' Mr. Sultan said.
