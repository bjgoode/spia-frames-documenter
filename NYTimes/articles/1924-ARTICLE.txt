THREATS AND RESPONSES; Defiant Hussein Gives Interview And a Challenge
By Bill Carter

Saddam Hussein said yesterday that he would resist demands by Hans Blix, a chief United Nation weapons inspector, to destroy Iraq's Al Samoud missiles, and Mr. Hussein renewed a challenge to President Bush to debate on international television.

Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi president, made the comments in an interview yesterday with the CBS News anchor, Dan Rather, the first American journalist to interview Mr. Hussein since President Bush declared his intention to disarm Iraq.

Mr. Rather reported the first bits of news from the interview on the ''CBS Evening News,'' and said CBS would provide more information as well as the first pictures from the interview on its morning news show today and its newscast this evening.

Tapes from the interview could not be transmitted and fully produced in time to use last night, Mr. Rather said. Instead, Mr. Rather himself reported briefly on what he called ''some of the headlines.''

The bulk of the interview, which Mr. Rather said took place over three hours, will be broadcast on the CBS newsmagazine program ''60 Minutes II'' tomorrow night.

Security for the meeting was ''extremely heavy,'' Mr. Rather said, and involved taking what he called a ''roundabout route'' to the location, a Baghdad palace.

Mr. Rather interviewed Mr. Hussein in 1990 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He said numerous CBS staff members helped him land the interview. But he also said he received some special help from Ramsey Clark, a former United States attorney general, who has been in Baghdad and met earlier with Mr. Hussein.
