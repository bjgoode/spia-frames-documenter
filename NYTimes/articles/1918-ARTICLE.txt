Rumsfeld Discounts Iraq's Offer to Discuss Pilot's Fate

The Bush administration voiced deep skepticism today over a reported offer from Iraq to discuss the status of an American pilot who was shot down there in 1991.

Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that Iraq's supposed offer to discuss Lt. Cmdr. Michael Scott Speicher had been reported only through news media outlets and not through formal channels between the countries.

''I don't believe very much that the regime of Saddam Hussein puts out,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''They're masters at propaganda.''

He added, ''We're not aware of any offer by the Iraqi government.''

Mr. Rumsfeld was responding to reports from Chinese and American news services that the Iraqi Foreign Ministry had offered to receive an American delegation to discuss Commander Speicher under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Commander Speicher, a Navy fighter pilot, became the first American casualty of the Persian Gulf war when his Navy F-18 jet was shot down by Iraq.

While he was originally presumed dead, last year the Pentagon changed his status to missing in action, based on intelligence reports that he might still be alive.

Iraq has never disclosed what it knows about Commander Speicher's fate, despite repeated inquiries from the United States.

Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, accused Iraq of a public relations ploy.

If Iraq were serious, he said, it would approach the United States through the ''established mechanism'' of the Tripartite Commission, which includes America's Persian Gulf war allies and the Red Cross.

''If Iraq is serious about wanting to address this humanitarian issue, they have only to respond to the specific questions through any one of our formal channels,'' Mr. Boucher said.
