Israel to Follow U.S. Lead if Iraq Is Attacked
Sept. 14, 2002

Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said today that his country would follow the lead of the United States in any war against Iraq.

''There will be only one command -- not two commands,'' Mr. Peres said at a meeting with the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Logic dictates that we follow American advice.''

Israeli officials had suggested that they would retain the right to respond should Iraq attack their territory in a war with the United States.

During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Israel did not retaliate when hit by Iraqi Scud missiles, in order to avoid splitting the coalition of Arab states fighting with the United States to push Iraq out of Kuwait.

In any war against Iraq, Mr. Peres said, working with the United States would be easier. ''The same inhibitions won't exist this time because there is no Arab coalition,'' he said.

While Mr. Peres said the administration must decide whether to go to war without considering Israel, he left no doubt that he felt Mr. Bush had no choice but to attack Iraq.

''To postpone the attack now is taking the same risk maybe as in 1939, in the face of Adolf Hitler,'' he said. ''Time is very short. The lives of innocent people are in danger.''

Mr. Peres added, ''We can imagine now some of the dangers, but this is our duty.''
