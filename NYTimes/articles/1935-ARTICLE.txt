THREATS AND RESPONSES; Senator Deplores Attack on Iraq
March 20, 2003

Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the senior member of the Senate, said today that he mourned the prospects for his nation at the start of the war with Iraq that he has long opposed.

Mr. Byrd, a Democrat first elected in 1958, said the Bush administration had made the world a more dangerous place by flaunting the nation's superpower status and asserting a new doctrine of pre-emption without international sanction.

''Today I weep for my country,'' Mr. Byrd, said, in his latest floor speech against the war. ''I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of America one of a strong yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed.''

Now, he said, the nation is mistrusted around the world, its intentions are questioned. The administration has forgotten, he said, that the country's true power lies in its ability to inspire, not intimidate.


''When did we become a nation that ignores and berates our friends and calls them irrelevant?'' he asked. ''When did we decide to risk undermining international order by adopting a radical doctrinaire approach to using our awesome military might?''

Mr. Byrd said he would pray for the safety of American troops and innocent civilians in Iraq.
