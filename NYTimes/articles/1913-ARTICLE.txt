Mideast Turmoil: Baghdad; Deal Revises Iraq Penalties

Russia and the United States reached broad tentative agreement today on how to revise penalties against Iraq by lifting controls altogether on thousands of food products, aid supplies and medicines.

At the same time, the two-day negotiating session between Assistant Secretary of State John Wolf and Yuri Fedotov of the Russian Foreign Ministry produced an agreement on common definitions for civilian products that might have military applications and would remain banned or subject to special review.

Mr. Fedotov told Russian reporters that the agreement has the effect of freeing $740 million in Russian contracts to supply goods to Iraq, which removes much of the $860 million backlog that Russia had accumulated as a result of American objections in the United Nations review process.

Thousands of civilian products, like large truck tires, and all manner of tools and machinery, were being held up by American objections that they could have military application. The American proposal for banned civilian goods runs to thousands of pages, Russian officials said.

In this week's talks, ''things like 'small' were further defined, things like 'trucks' were better defined,'' Mr. Wolf told reporters as he left Moscow.

The agreement paves the way for the United Nations Security Council to again take up before the end of May an American proposal to impose ''smart sanctions'' on Iraq that will lift restrictions on food, civilian technologies and relief goods exported to Iraq. Last summer, Russia threatened to veto the proposal but has gradually shifted ground since Sept. 11.

Mr. Wolf said the new sanctions regime ''is designed to make clear that the international community is interposing no barriers on goods going to Iraq's civilian economy, but that it is determined to keep rigorous controls on things that Iraq could use to reconstitute its military capability.''
