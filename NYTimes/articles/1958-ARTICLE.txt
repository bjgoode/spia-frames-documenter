Secretary General Kofi Annan will hold a second round of talks with Foreign Minister Naji Sabri of Iraq, left, in the first three days of May, his spokesman said. The meetings, which are expected to focus on the return of United Nations arms inspectors to Iraq, were originally scheduled for April 18 and 19 but were delayed at Iraq's request to keep attention on the conflict in the Middle East. Hans Blix, the chief arms inspector for the United Nations, and Muhammad el-Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, are expected to attend. The last meeting between the Secretary General and Mr. Sabri was on March 7. Daniel B. Schneider (NYT)
