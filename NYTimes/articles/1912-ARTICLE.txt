A veteran West Virginia lawmaker who visited Iraq over the weekend said he told that nation's leaders that allowing ''unconditional and unfettered'' access to weapons inspectors was the only way to prevent military action by the United States.

Representative Nick J. Rahall II, speaking by telephone from Damascus, Syria, said he told Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, that, ''George Bush is serious, that he will have the support of the American people once his decision is made to send American forces into harm's way.''

Mr. Rahall, a Democrat, said that in his two-hour session with Mr. Aziz, he also said that if Iraq wanted to ''prevent another devastating defeat, which it would be, that the best course of action for the people of Iraq'' was to allow the inspectors in.

Mr. Rahall said he was trying to ''cool the rhetoric'' on both sides. He was part of a delegation that included former Senator James G. Abourezk of South Dakota. Both men are of Arab-American background.

Mr. Rahall said the trip was cleared by both the State and Treasury Departments. ''This was an honest, sincere effort to jar open that door toward a peaceful resolution,'' he said.

''There is a resignation among the people and the leadership that we are darned if we do, darned if we don't, that it just doesn't matter how many hoops we jump through,'' said Mr. Rahall. . ''You can sense not so much they wanted to hide anything, but it being a matter of Arab pride.''

The delegation had requested a meeting with the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, but did not get an interview. They met with the leader of the national assembly, had a meeting in a private home, toured a hospital and Mr. Rahall said he attended Sunday services at a Christian church.
