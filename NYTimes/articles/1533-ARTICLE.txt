THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; Stocks Plunge On Concerns About Iraq And Economy

Stocks fell on Wall Street and abroad yesterday as investors faced a week packed with uncertainty about a war with Iraq, the outlook for corporate earnings and the economy over all.

The week will also be filled with significant events, including President Bush's State of the Union address tonight and the meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers today and tomorrow.

During a day in which the three major market gauges on Wall Street fell more than 1.3 percent -- the Dow Jones industrial average closed below 8,000 -- and several main markets in Europe were down more than 3 percent, investors continued to receive mixed signals on the immediacy of a war with Iraq.

The investor George Soros, who was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, told Bloomberg News that ''investors should avoid big bets until the uncertainty around Iraq is resolved.''


Today investors will be looking to the State of Union address, some analysts said, for signs that Washington will be able to have a plan quickly approved for igniting economic growth.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished yesterday at their lowest levels since October, which was just days after both gauges had fallen to five-year lows. Since reaching a high for the year on Jan. 14, the Dow, the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index are down more than 9 percent and are in negative territory for the year.

Hans Blix, the chief United Nations inspector for biological and chemical weapons, said yesterday that there was evidence that Iraq was developing nerve gas and was not accepting disarmament.

At the same time, Mohamed ElBaradei, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, asked for more time to conduct additional inspections.

The White House said that the report from the United Nations indicated that Iraq had failed to comply with resolutions on disarmament but it set no deadlines. ''The process is continuing, but the process is running out of time,'' Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, told reporters. Mr. Fleischer also said that the State of the Union address would not include a deadline or a declaration of war.

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said at a news conference yesterday that the United States would be consulting with its allies before it announced its next step and whether it would agree to give weapons inspectors more time.

The fact that there is some confusion about the outlook could be seen in the performance of the stock and bond markets. While stocks were falling, prices in the Treasury market also declined, sending yields higher. Recently, bonds have tended to rally when stocks fell and a war with Iraq looked more likely. But yesterday, bonds may have declined because some investors felt that a war with Iraq might be delayed as inspections continued and the Bush administration worked to obtain more support from its allies, which are sharply divided over a war.

The Dow declined 141.45 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 7,989.56, while the S.& P. 500 dropped 13.92 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 847.48. The Nasdaq fell 16.87 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,325.27. The Dow is off 4.2 percent for the year; the S.& P. 500 is down 3.7 percent; and the Nasdaq is 0.8 percent lower.

In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 3.97 percent from 3.93 percent on Friday. The note's price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 10/32, to 100 9/32.

Drug industry stocks were the biggest losers among the sectors of the S.& P. 500 as reports ahead of Mr. Bush's State of the Union address said that the president would propose a prescription drug program for the elderly that could make drug makers reduce prices. Shares of Merck fell $1.79, to $51.76; and Eli Lilly dropped $1.36, to $60.22.

Telecommunication companies, like AT&T, and information technology companies, like Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, have been the biggest losers since Jan. 14.

The S.& P.'s telecommunication services index is down 16 percent since then, while the information technology index is showing a loss of 12.1 percent. For the first two weeks of the year, these indexes led the market higher.

Some analysts, like Henry J. Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan., think that the weakness of earnings and the economy are more of a drag on the market than the threat of a war.

''The underpinning of the economy is not vigorous,'' Mr. Herrmann said. ''We need a stimulus package, and the market is fretting over that. The economic package is more important than the war.''
