As Worries Over Iraq War Rise, So Does the Price of Crude Oil

Oil prices rose to two-year highs today, building on a weeklong surge after an emergency OPEC decision to raise output failed to assuage growing fears over a possible war in Iraq.

Crude oil rose 1.4 percent today, to $33.66 a barrel in New York trading. In London, Brent crude rose 1.5 percent, to $31.70 a barrel.

Oil prices have risen 6 percent since Sunday, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its official production quota by 6.5 percent, to 24.5 million barrels a day.

Since the meeting, concerns about Iraq have grown, with one of the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, Hans Blix, warning today that the situation ''is very tense and very dangerous.''


The OPEC meeting in Vienna was ostensibly called to address the supply disruption caused by antigovernment strikes in Venezuela. But analysts said the increase in quotas was unlikely to fill all of the gap.

''The market is nervous, and it is going to stay so for a while, as long as it doesn't know what is going to happen in Venezuela and Iraq,'' said Vera de Ladoucette, director of Middle East Research for Cambridge Energy Research Associates.

Adding to the short-term worry over supplies were disruptions in shipments from Norway this week. Bad weather prevented tankers from being loaded, while damage to an oil rig briefly limited production.

Analysts said OPEC's new production efforts would fall short of the 1.5 million extra barrels promised by the group. That is because the higher quotas were assigned proportionally to all members, including Venezuela, which is producing only about one-quarter of the 2.82 million barrels a day that it will be allowed to pump under the new system, due to take effect Feb. 1.

''As soon as OPEC agreed to include Venezuela, the numbers were meaningless,'' said Leonidas Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies in London.
