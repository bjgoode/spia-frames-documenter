Ex-Hostages Seek Release of Iraqi Funds
Sept. 24, 2002

A group of American citizens who were held hostage by President Saddam Hussein after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and who later won legal damages against Iraq, asked a federal judge yesterday to order a New York bank that holds Iraqi assets to release the funds so the judgments can be paid.

A petition filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan contends that the bank, J. P. Morgan Chase, will not release the money to pay the judgments, which range from $136,000 to $1.749 million, because Iraqi assets have been frozen by the United States government.

The petition was filed against J. P. Morgan as well as the Treasury Department.

Another bank that holds Iraqi assets, the Bank of New York, will be added to the petition in the future, said Daniel Wolf, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.

Mr. Wolf said that more than 100 other people who were held hostage and have won court judgments would also be added to the petition.
