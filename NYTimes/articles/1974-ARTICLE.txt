The deputy transport minister, Behzad Mazaheri, announced that Iran would soon start using Iraqi airspace for direct flights to Syria and would resume flights to Iraq, its former bitter enemy, ''once suitable grounds are prepared.'' The decision was made after the Iraqi transport minister visited Iran last week. Many Iranian pilgrims visit Shiite sites in Syria and Iraq. Nazila Fathi (NYT)
