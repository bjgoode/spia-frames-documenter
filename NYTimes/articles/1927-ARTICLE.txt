A NATION AT WAR: FEDAYEEN; New Iraqi Force Emerges

The fedayeen, believed to have been involved in the capture of American soldiers today, have emerged as a new and unexpected threat to American forces.

The fedayeen are a militia that is commanded by Saddam Hussein's son Uday. Their members are recruited from one of several security agencies and intelligence services and from Iraq's Republican Guard. There are an estimated 60,000 members and as many as 1,000 in southern Iraq opposing American forces.

American officials are well aware of the fedayeen and thought they might confront them in Baghdad or in some southern cities. But they did not expect them to be so aggressive.

The fedayeen are equipped with sports utility vehicles, light trucks, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. They do not wear uniforms but are dressed in black or civilian clothes, United States officials said.


They may not be the only irregular forces operating in the south. Some of the other fighters who have ambushed American troops may include hard-core Baath Party officials and members of Iraq's intelligence organization.

Mr. Hussein has set up multiple security organizations to ensure that his survival does not depend on a single organization and to establish a system in which the organizations watch each other.

The most dedicated members of the fedayeen are organized in the ''Golden Company.'' They are described as a group of militants who are prepared to fight to the death.
