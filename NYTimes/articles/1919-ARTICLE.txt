THREATS AND RESPONSES: IRAQI ARMS; U.S. Asks U.N. To Speed Pace Of Inspections

The United States, eager to press the pace of arms inspections in Iraq, called today for a Security Council session on Thursday to air a dispute over the inspectors' schedule.

The new argument stems from differing understandings in Washington and other capitals of nations on the Council of the two resolutions that guide the inspections.

It started after Hans Blix, the chief biological and chemical weapons inspector, pointed out that no deadlines were specified after the end of January in Resolution 1441, the Nov. 8 measure that set up the current round of inspections. On Jan. 27 the inspectors are required to report on the first 60 days of their work.

Mr. Blix said that after the Jan. 27 report, he would follow the steps outlined in Resolution 1284, the December 1999 measure that first created the inspection teams. On that basis, he said he would make a new, major report at the end of March. Resolution 1284 holds out much more explicitly than the more recent one the promise that severe economic sanctions will be lifted if Iraq meets the demands of the inspections.

Bush administration officials, particularly the White House national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, became alarmed that Mr. Blix's view could slow the inspections and suggest to Iraq that the Council was satisfied with its performance so far. She explained her concerns to Mr. Blix in a meeting in New York on Tuesday, and the American ambassador, John D. Negroponte, laid them out at a Council luncheon that day.

British and French diplomats said today they see no conflict between the two resolutions.
