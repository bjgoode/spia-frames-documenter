Representatives of 29 countries and 21 aid groups warned of devastating humanitarian consequences of a war in Iraq as they ended a two-day meeting in Geneva over the weekend aimed at preparing relief efforts in case of a conflict. Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey, who organized the meeting on behalf of the Swiss government, said in her opening comments that faced with the numbers of Iraqis who could be injured, killed or made refugees in a war, ''inaction and indifference cannot be permitted.'' Absent from the meeting was the United States, which declined an invitation saying its relief planning has been under way for several months. All other Security Council members, as well as states neighboring Iraq, were represented. Iraq was not invited, organizers said, because of an effort to avoid politicizing the event. Issues on the agenda included caring for distressed civilians, ensuring that humanitarian laws are respected, assessing environmental damage and helping neighboring countries share the burden of the huge number of refugees expected to flee during and after any war. The United Nations has estimated that in the event of a war, around two million Iraqis would be forced to leave their homes, while anywhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million would flee the country altogether. Further, Iraq's current level of food supplies are expected to last no more than six weeks from the start of a war, and drinking water supplies could be affected immediately. Alison Langley (NYT)
